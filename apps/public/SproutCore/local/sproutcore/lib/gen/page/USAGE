page - Create a new SproutCore page target.

USAGE:

  sc-gen page PageName [--filename=FILENAME] [--target=TARGET_NAME]

DISCUSSION:

*IMPORTANT:* This generator does not create a page design (e.g. main_page.js) in an app.  Use "sc-gen design" instead.

This generator will create a new SproutCore page for a particular project.  A page is much like an app but you will often place primarily static content here.  You should pass as the first parameter your PageName you want to create.  For example:

sc-gen page NotFound

defines a new page called NotFound in the file pages/not_found/.
